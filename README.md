## About

This project is about creating a simple wireframe model representation of a 3D landscape by linking various points (x, y, z) thanks to line segments (edges).

I used the Codam <a href="https://github.com/codam-coding-college/MLX42">MLX42</a> graphics library.

Usage:

`./fdf maps/<map_name>.fdf`

## Bonus

- Include one extra projection (such as parallel or conic)!
- Zoom in and out.
- Translate your model.
- Rotate your model.
- Add one more bonus of your choice: I added colours.
